# Framing Gender
By [Monsicha Srisuantang](https://github.com/monsichasris) and [Harshita Chakravadhanula](https://github.com/hushbrush)

This project explores the sitters through the lens of gender. Portraits are grouped based on realm, and then based on the role within each realm. Portraits are further contextualised by decade.
