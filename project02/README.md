<h4>Portraits and Passions: Unveiling the Lives Behind the Sitters in the NPG</h4>
<p>
This visualization looks at the “careers” of the sitters in the NPG, grouped by male and female. There are characteristics for the sitter listed in the Topic of each entry, for example: “Harry Houdini: Arts & Culture\Performing Arts\Performer\Magician”. These categorizations lend themselves well to a hierarchical visualization so we’ve chosen to use a tree-map so that the main categories are easily apparent for each group, and then users can discover deeper levels. The rectangular presentation is also reminiscent of the shape of a frame, which would be referenced in the design. There are 14,469 total documents in the NPG collection (10,889 men, 3,601 women), and we would exclude all group portraits.
